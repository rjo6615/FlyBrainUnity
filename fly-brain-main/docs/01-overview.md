# 1. Overview

## Goal
Put the male fruit fly connectome in a physically realistic body, place it in environments, and let the
brain decide what the fly does. Sensory responses come from the connectome. The spontaneous part of
behaviour, which the model has no neuromodulation to produce, comes from an endogenous-activity module
that acts only as synaptic input to identified descending neurons ([Endogenous behaviour](23-behaviour.md)).

## The closed loop
Every simulated millisecond, for each fly:

1. The physics state is read: joint angles, foot contacts, body position, head orientation.
2. Senses convert that state into firing rates of identified sensory neurons.
3. The eyes cast rays, run the flyvis optic-lobe model, and drive matching optic-lobe neurons.
4. The endogenous-activity module adds its synaptic input to descending neurons, then the brain advances
   two 0.5 ms spiking steps over 10.5 million connections — on a WebGPU kernel when available, else
   WebAssembly ([WebGPU](27-webgpu.md)).
5. The motor layer reads descending and motor neurons and sets actuator targets.
6. In flight, blade-element aerodynamic forces from the real 218 Hz wing stroke act on the body, and the
   legs take their flight posture ([Flight](24-flight.md)).
7. MuJoCo advances the body five 0.2 ms physics steps.

| Gait kinematics | FlySuite walking dataset | Real-fly joint trajectories |

## Two motor modes
- **Descending commands** is the default. The brain's descending neurons set walking, turning, backing,
  grooming, and escape. A stepping pattern generator executes the legs. This mirrors published embodied
  models such as NeuroMechFly v2 and Eon Systems' fly.
- **Full connectome VNC** is experimental. Every leg muscle is driven by its own motor neurons through the
  raw nerve-cord wiring. The fly cannot stand in this mode, which is the honest result.

## Scale
One fly runs at about 0.2 times real time. Five flies ran together on a 12-core Mac.
